## ðŸ§  Method Overview

Accurate segmentation of tibial plateau fractures (TPF) from CT scans is highly challenging due to complex fracture
patterns and the need for expert-level annotations. To address these challenges, our method introduces a novel training
strategy based on masked autoencoders (MAE) for semi-supervised TPF segmentation.

The proposed approach consists of two stages:

- **MAE Pretraining:** We utilize a masked autoencoder to learn global skeletal structure and fine-grained fracture
  details from large amounts of unlabeled CT scans. This self-supervised stage enables the model to capture both
  anatomical context and subtle fracture cues.

- **Fine-tuning with Limited Annotations:** The pretrained model is then fine-tuned using a small set of labeled data (
  only 20 cases), significantly reducing annotation requirements while maintaining high segmentation performance.

Our strategy improves the model's ability to generalize across different fracture morphologies and datasets. Experiments
on a proprietary dataset of 180 TPF CT scans show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
semi-supervised approaches, with a Dice score of **95.81%**, ASSD of **1.91mm**, and 95HD of **9.42mm**. Furthermore, it
demonstrates strong transferability to other fracture types, such as hip fractures in a public pelvic CT dataset,
indicating its broader applicability in orthopedic image analysis.
